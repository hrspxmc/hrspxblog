Smalltalk programming language 
<!--more-->

> *Best way to predict the future is to invent it* - Alan Kay

# 

$$ \textrm{Smalltalk} = \textrm{Language} + \textrm{Class Library} + \textrm{Development Environment} $$

Lets break this down term by term:

+ Language

+ Class Library

+ Development Enviroment

# Modern implementations

## GNU Smalltalk

## Squeak

## Pharo

## Cuis

## Amber

If you are looking for:
 - essential smalltalk experiance, without bloated IDE, use **GNU** implementation.  
 - someting closer to original experiance use **Squeak**.  
 - most developed modern succesor use **Pharo**
 - something between Cuis and Pharo
